# spotfix
Spotfix allows you to add songs on Spotify to a blacklist so that they're automatically skipped.
Runs in the background, guarding your ears from the vile tracks the algorithm keeps thinking you'll like.

## Installation
TODO: Figure out homebrew stuff.

## Usage
```
spotfix --add <track-uri>
        --remove
```
To get the URI of a track on Spotify, right-click on it and go to the Share option. The "Copy Song Link" option will switch to "Copy Spotify URI" on holding down the `Ctrl` key.
